Important changes (deprecations) coming in PowerApps, Power Automate, and model-driven apps in Dynamics 365
============================================================

The announcements and deprecations described in this topic apply to PowerApps, Power Automate, and model-driven apps in Dynamics 365 (Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Dynamics 365 Marketing, Dynamics 365 Field Service, and Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation).

Administrators and IT professionals should use this information to prepare for future releases. This article was first published on June 27, 2017.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> “Deprecated” means we intend to remove the feature or capability from a future major release. The feature or capability will continue to work and is fully supported until it is officially removed. This deprecation
notification can span a few years. After removal, the feature or capability will no longer work. We are notifying you now so you have sufficient time to plan and update your code before the feature or capability is removed.

Rules feature in canvas apps is deprecated
----------------------------------

Effective October 14, 2019, the [rules](/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/working-with-rules) feature in canvas apps in PowerApps is deprecated. Few people have made use of rules in their canvas apps. From feedback collected through research and discussions with makers of PowerApps, the rules feature was confusing, and expressions were easier to learn, use, and debug. For more information about the rules feature deprecation, see [Blog: Canvas Rules feature deprecation](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/blog/canvas-rules-feature-deprecation/).


Legacy web client is deprecated
-------------------------------
As of September 2019, the legacy web client is deprecated. Customers must transition to Unified Interface before October 1, 2020. Microsoft will continue to provide support, security and other critical updates to the legacy web client until October 1, 2020 but won't release any additional functionality beyond what has already been announced.
  
On October 1, 2020, the legacy web client will no longer be available. Organizations should make the transition to the Unified Interface as soon as possible to take advantage of Microsoft’s ongoing investments in reliability, performance, and functionality. 
 
In the coming months, for those that have not already made the transition, we will be sending reminders and scheduling updates to transition customers to Unified Interface prior to October 1, 2020. 
For further information and steps to make a smooth transition, view our helpful resources and community site:

    Group](https://community.dynamics.com/365/unified-interface/) including a

    default](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/transition-web-app)

Task flows are deprecated
-------------------------
[Task flows](/flow/create-mobile-task-flow) are used to create a step-by-step data entry form for common tasks, such as after-meeting follow-ups. 

Task flows are deprecated and will be removed by October 1, 2020. They will be
replaced by the immersive experience for business process flows that is planned
for release. More information: [Business process flow immersive
experiences](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform-release-plan/2019wave2/microsoft-flow/business-process-immersive-experiences)

Process Dialogs are deprecated
------------------------------

You can use a process dialog to create an interactive step-by-step data entry
form that requires user input to start and run to completion. When you start the
dialog process, a wizard-like interface is presented; users make selections or
enter data as they progress through each page of the wizard.

Process dialogs are deprecated and will be removed by October 1, 2020. Suggested replacement options include Business Process Flows or Canvas Apps. More information: [Replace dialogs with business process flows or canvas apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/flow/replace-dialogs)

Legacy process-related attributes in entities are deprecated
------------------------------------------------------------

The legacy process-related attributes (such as **StageId**, and **TraversedPath**) on entities enabled for business process flows are now deprecated. The **SetProcess** action for business process flows is also deprecated. Manipulating these legacy process-related attributes for target entity records does not guarantee consistency of the business process flow state, and is not a supported scenario. The recommended way is to use the attributes of the business process flow entity. More information: [Create, retrieve, update, and delete business process flow entity records](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/developer/model-business-process-flows#create-retrieve-update-and-delete-business-process-flow-entity-records-process-instances)

Some client APIs are deprecated
-------------------------------

The following client APIs are deprecated to reorganize the Xrm client API object model to better align with the need of using the same
client scripts without having to change them based on the context or the client
(web client or the new Unified Interface) where they run. You should plan to use
the new client APIs mentioned in the **Replacement Client API** column instead
of the deprecated ones. The deprecated client APIs will continue to be available
and supported until they are officially removed from a future major release. *A public announcement here in the documentation, on the Dynamics 365 blog, and in many other places will be made at least six months before removal.*

Based on the feedback, we understand that the usage of **Xrm.Page** is high, and it won’t be removed as soon as some other client API methods listed in this section. We encourage you to use the new way of getting form content where possible.

EntityMetadata.IsInteractionCentricEnabled property is deprecated
-----------------------------------------------------------------

All entities supported in the Unified Interface are now enabled for the interactive experience in the new Customer Service Hub app. This implies that
the **EntityMetadata**.[IsInteractionCentricEnabled](/dotnet/api/microsoft.xrm.sdk.metadata.entitymetadata.isinteractioncentricenabled)
property, which indicates whether an entity can be enabled for interactive experience, is no longer relevant. The corresponding setting for this property
in the Customization tool, **Enable for interactive experience**, is removed, and the
**EntityMetadata**.[IsInteractionCentricEnabled](/dotnet/api/microsoft.xrm.sdk.metadata.entitymetadata.isinteractioncentricenabled)
property will be removed from the future version.


Voice of the Customer is deprecated 
-----------------------------------
The Voice of the Customer solution is used to create and send surveys for collecting feedback.  

As of July 1, 2019, the Voice of the Customer solution is deprecated. Users can create and distribute new surveys and collect responses from live surveys till July 1, 2020. Please read this [blog post](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2097704) for more details. 

A new solution, Microsoft Forms Pro, is generally available to capture customer feedback using surveys. Customers can learn more about Forms Pro [here](https://formspro.microsoft.com). 

Dynamics 365 for Blackberry is deprecated
------------------------------------------
As of December 3, 2018, Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Blackberry App is deprecated and will be removed from the iOS App Store on October 31, 2019. The mobile app is currently available on the iOS App Store and is designed for Dynamics 365 customers that utilize Blackberry Mobile Application Management. See more details about the Dynamics 365 for Blackberry app here: [Secure your mobile data with Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Good](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/mobile-app/v8/go-mobile/admin-troubleshoot/secure-mobile-data-dynamics-365-good). After October 31, 2019, Microsoft Intune will be the only supported mobile application management solution for the [Dynamics 365 for phones application](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/mobile-app/install-dynamics-365-for-phones-and-tablets). 

Microsoft will continue to provide security and other critical updates to the Dynamics 365 for Blackberry App until October 31, 2019, but will not release any additional features or functionalities within the app. After October 31, 2019, the Dynamics 365 for Blackberry App will be removed from the App Store, and support will end.

**What should you do?**

If you are currently using the Dynamics 365 for Blackberry App together with Mobile Application Management for Blackberry, plan to migrate to Dynamics 365 for phones by October 31, 2019. We encourage you to migrate as soon as possible to take advantage of Microsoft’s ongoing investments in the reliability, performance, and functionality of the Dynamics 365 mobile app.


Service scheduling in Dynamics 365 Customer Service is deprecated
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The existing service scheduling functionality is deprecated and will be removed in a future major release. The new scheduling experience, built atop Universal Resource Scheduling (URS), is now available on the Unified Interface.

Existing service scheduling users will be provided advance notice for a timebound migration to the new scheduling capabilities.

Usage of Parature knowledgebase as the knowledge management solution is deprecated
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Usage of Parature knowledgebase as the knowledge
management solution is deprecated. This feature is replaced by Knowledge
Management features in Dynamics 365 Customer Service.

The **Knowledge Solution** setting in the **Knowledge Base Management Settings**
dialog box, which provides a connection to Parature will be removed in a future major release.
